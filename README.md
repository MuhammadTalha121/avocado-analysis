# Avocado Price Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing avocado prices using data science techniques. The goal is to understand the factors influencing avocado prices, identify trends, and explore opportunities for market expansion.

## Project Structure
- **data**: Contains the dataset used for analysis (e.g., avocado prices by region, time series data).
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data cleaning, exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- **scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and geographical mapping.
- **reports**: Generated reports, visualizations, and insights from the analysis.
- **README.md**: Project overview, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MuhammadTalha121/avocado-analysis.git`
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the dataset and place it in the `data` directory.
4. Open Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE to explore the notebooks and scripts.

## Usage
1. Start by exploring the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data cleaning, exploration, and analysis.
2. Run the scripts in the `scripts` directory for preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning models, and GIS mapping.
3. Generate reports and visualizations to communicate findings and insights.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data manipulation and visualization)
